## Didats Triadi 

I am iOS & macOS Developer since iOS was version 5.0, and start writing macOS app since macOS version 10.11.x. Loved coding with Swift, able to speak with PHP and a little bit Javascript and Go. Other than writing codes, I also enjoy designing an app with Sketch. Most of the app I have built designed by my own self.

I am currently staying in Malang, Indonesia. 1 hour distance by plane from the capital city, Jakarta. I do like outside activities such as üö¥ and üèÉ. Loved Americano and Moccachino.
