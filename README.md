## Didats Triadi 

Currently iOS & macOS Developer. Former web developer. Able to speak with Swift, Objective C and PHP. Quite confident with Python and Go, but not on the level that I could call myself Python or Go Developer. I also loved doing design UI with Sketch, all of the apps that I have built are designed by me.

I am currently staying in Malang, Indonesia. 1 hour distance by plane from the capital city, Jakarta. Other than writing codes, I do like outside activities such as üö¥ and üèÉ. Every single month, I tried to push myself to run 100km, and bike for minimum 800km with 7500m elevation.

If somehow you asked me to go to a cafe, I would order Americano or Moccachino. Both of them giving me a good moood for a full day.

And if you are an iOS Developer, you might want to use these 2 libraries I have made:  
* [DTSocialMediaLogin](https://github.com/didats/DTSocialMediaLogin), helping you to implement social media login.
* [DTStringPicker](https://github.com/didats/DTStringPicker), a dropdown menu with ability to search the data

If you wanted to make your own API, Slim Framework is my recommendation. I made a template for you to get started easier.
* [Slim 4 Template](https://github.com/didats/Slim4-Template), Slim 4 Template, for easier starting point
